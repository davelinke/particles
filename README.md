A minimal ES6 web component library

When creating web applications oftentimes there are many decisions in terms of the frameworks to bundle with your project to make it easier and mor straightforward to achieve consistency around a specified architecture.

Amongst all those choices there are magnificent ones, The Angulars, Reacts, Vues, etc.

This component library is the result of **choosing not to choose**. Creating components around the technologies bundled with your browser without adding overhead to simple things as styling the very bare elements that you commonly find in web applications.

It is true that on this process I have created a framework of my own, somehow I have only added a few things that you may find useful without much overhead. This would be, having a development space within the **src** folder in which you'll find the code to work on.

The **node-scripts** folder where there are a few scripts that take care of streamlining the html, javascript and scss code and building the assets to serve and the **dist** folder where all things build are deposited.

If you want to use the compliled components **dist** is where you get them.

If you want to modify them run this repo locally and put your hands to work on the src folder.

I hope you find this simplistic approach useful.

## Run it locally
